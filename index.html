            Hello, my name is Tron Johnson and I am an aspiring web developer and graphic designer.
            I graduated in field of Information Technology and worked in the industry for the past five years. Recently I've desired a career change due to a growing lack of interest. Understanding my natural aptitude for art, design, and the creation of things, I decided to make the jump into web design. Front End Development for me has become the perfect balance between technical and artistic skill sets. I am driven by the creative side of websites and the challenges coding has to offer. I enjoy pushing the envelope with artistic designs without hindering user experience and usability. My long term educational and career goals is to continue training into back end development and to deliver full stack services.
